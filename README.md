# Python Programming Fundamental Portfolio

This repository showcases foundational projects developed through self-directed learning, focusing on the practical application of core concepts. 

**The work demonstrates proficiency in:**

<ul><li>Core Python Concepts and Command-Line Interface (CLI) Design.
</li><li>Integration of External Libraries (e.g., JSON, OS functions, specific Python libraries).
</li><li>Foundational Algorithmic Problem-Solving (e.g., mathematical and game logic).
</li><li>Robust Input Validation and Error Handling across projects (e.g., managing non-numeric input and illegal commands).
</li><li>Version Control and Professional Workflow via Git and GitHub, including consistent commit practices and repository management.</li></ul>

## Project 1: Battleship

**Goal:** To create a fully functional, two-player command-line game, managing complex game state across 10x10 grids.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
<ul><li>Input Validation: Robust handling of user ship placement and attack coordinate entries and validation of placement rules (e.g., bounds, adjacency).
</li><li>Data Management: Implementing efficient logic to track hits, misses, boards. and game save/load functionality using JSON.
</li><li>Procedural Logic Design: Structured the entire game flow using functions and global data structures (e.g., lists of lists) to manage two concurrent game states.
</li><li>Interface Design: Creating a clear and functional command-line user experience with the help of the os and Simple Colors libraries.</li></ul>

## Project 2: Quadratic Solver

**Goal:** To build a reliable tool for solving quadratic equations ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$), including handling all three cases (real, one, or complex roots). 

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
<ul><li>Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Developed using a dedicated class (e.g., QuadraticEquation) to cleanly encapsulate the coefficients and all root-finding logic, emphasizing code reusability and modularity.
</li><li>Command-Line Argument Parsing: Designed the program to accept coefficients ($a, b, c$) directly as command-line arguments, demonstrating the ability to interface with the operating system and build non-interactive tools.
</li><li>Algorithmic Thinking: Successfully implemented the quadratic formula and logical branching based on the discriminant, ensuring accurate mathematical output for all scenarios</li></ul>

## Next Steps

I am currently redesigning the Battleship project in Java to incorporate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, focusing on creating dedicated classes and methods for improved modularity and scale.
